Millennium Crisis take two.

This version will most likely not be updated as I have started to work on 
a new version that's written in Java. 

The current version was written in C++ on Linux using the Code Blocks IDE. I know that the version
on here should compile and run on a similar set up. It SHOULD also compile on any system that has 
SDL and SDL_ttf dependencies set up, though I haven't tried it. Code Blocks is also a cross
platform IDE so it might be easiest to get it running / building there. Down the line I might add 
a Windows compiled version here if I ever decide to give that a try.

New (better) Java version of this game can be found here: https://github.com/shamrice/ZombieAttack

Thanks!
